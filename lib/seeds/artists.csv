Drama credits include three seasons of the RTS Award-winning The Indian Doctor. Barnaby's first feature film, Camera Trap, directed by Alex Verner, will be released in by Pinewood/Cinema NX later this year, 2014. Music has always been a part of Barnaby’s life. He grew up around the folk music scene of which his singer-songwriter father, Allan Taylor, was a major part. Other interests led him to do a zoology degree that got him his first production jobs, as a film researcher at the BBC Natural History Unit and later at Icon Films, Bristol. However, this production work sparked his ambition to write music for picture and he was soon drawn back to his musical roots. Barnaby is sought after for his versatile, intuitive approach, and talent for working across musical genres. His scores range from the gritty and hard-hitting Calling the Shots (2005), a feature-length documentary for National Geographic on the Israeli Reuters News Agency, to lyrical acoustic scores, as heard in the BBC’s Bear Family and Me (2011). Barnaby works regularly with top-flight orchestras such as the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the BBC Concert Orchestra, to produce rich and dramatic scores, as heard in the three-part BBC series Ganges (2007) and, most recently, in the BBC’s Wild Arabia where the orchestral score was augmented with percussion and ethnic instruments recorded at Abbey Road studios. For the BBC series Wild China (2008), he composed pieces for classical Chinese instrumentation, performed by the UK Chinese Music Ensemble. These were used alongside orchestral compositions to produce the score that won him the 2009 News & Documentary Emmy for Best Music. Barnaby’s passion for recording with real musicians has taken him to Dhaka to record with Bangladeshi musicians for The Natural World: Man-eating Tigers of the Sundarbans (2008) and to Kenya, to record tribal voices and instruments for the BBC series The Great Rift (2010).His scores have also been brought to the stage. The Wild China score was performed by the UK Chinese Music Ensemble at London’s South Bank, and Nature’s Great Events LIVE was performed to rave reviews by the BBC Concert Orchestra with live narration by Sir David Attenborough.",,,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,,,,,,,,
